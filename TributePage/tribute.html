        <h2>Biogarphy</h2>
        <p>Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist. Born in Mvezo, he dedicated his life to fighting against racial oppression and inequality. Mandela became a symbol of hope and resilience, inspiring people worldwide with his unwavering commitment to justice and reconciliation.

            Mandela's activism began in the African National Congress (ANC), where he advocated for nonviolent resistance against apartheid. As apartheid policies intensified, he co-founded the ANC Youth League and later the armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, to challenge the oppressive regime.
            
            In 1962, Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment. Despite enduring 27 years of harsh conditions on Robben Island, he remained steadfast in his beliefs and became an international icon of the struggle for freedom. Mandela's release in 1990 marked a turning point in South African history.
            
            In 1994, Mandela was elected as South Africa's first black President, leading the country's transition to democracy and working to heal the wounds of apartheid. His presidency focused on reconciliation and promoting human rights for all South Africans.
            
            Mandela's legacy extends beyond his political achievements. He dedicated his post-presidential years to philanthropy and established the Nelson Mandela Foundation, focusing on education, healthcare, and combating HIV/AIDS.
            
            Nelson Mandela's life serves as a reminder of the power of forgiveness, unity, and perseverance in the face of adversity. His legacy continues to inspire generations, reminding us that the fight for justice and equality is an ongoing journey that requires courage and compassion.</p>
